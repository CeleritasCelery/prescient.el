# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog].

## 2.1 (released 2018-07-25)
### New features
* New user option `ivy-prescient-retain-classic-highlighting` allows
  you to more closely emulate the highlighting behavior of Ivy when
  `ivy-prescient-mode` is enabled ([#11]).

### Enhancements
* API function `prescient-filter-regexps` now has special behavior
  when the symbol `all` is passed as the `WITH-GROUPS` argument. The
  documentation string for this function, which was previously
  erroneous, has been fixed ([#11]).
* For some reason, Ivy explicitly supports candidates which are lists,
  by just taking their cars. `ivy-prescient.el` now does the same,
  instead of converting the lists to strings. This reduces bloat in
  the save file, and in some cases improves frequency tracking (for
  example, frequency tracking works much better for
  `org-refile-get-location`).

## 2.0 (released 2018-06-26)
### Changed
* `ivy-prescient.el` now clears the value of
  `ivy-initial-inputs-alist` when `ivy-prescient-mode` is enabled, in
  order to allow functions like `counsel-describe-function` to work
  out of the box ([#7]).

### Fixed
* Previously, `ivy-prescient.el` didn't work with the latest version
  of `counsel-projectile` because that package relied on certain
  undocumented semantics of the `ivy-read` API. This is now fixed
  ([#6]).
